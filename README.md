## About the Project

To determinate the effectiveness of a cancer treatment, the volume of treated and untreated tumours in mice was measured over time. Samples per mouse are not balanced. To conclude a significant effect in reducing the growth rate of the tumours based on the treatment, mixed linear models and robust estimations are used in this project. 

## The Code 

The code is fully in R and in one script. The "omega.r" file is a sideloaded script to compute and visualize the block correlation matrix Omega (Ω), based on the variance matrices of the fixed and random effects. For data rights reasons is the respective dataset not included in this repository. You can find all visualizations done in the code in the graphics folder.
